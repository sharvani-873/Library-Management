# Library-Management
The Library Management System is a Java-based desktop application developed to simplify and digitize the operations of a traditional library. Created by SkillsetAcademy, the project demonstrates how core Java concepts and database integration can be applied to build a fully functional software solution for real-world needs. This project is ideal for students and beginners looking to gain hands-on experience in Java development and backend connectivity.

The system uses Java Swing for its graphical user interface (GUI), providing an intuitive and interactive environment for both librarians and users. MySQL is used as the backend database to store all the necessary information such as book details, member records, and transaction history. Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) is employed to establish and manage the connection between the Java application and the MySQL database.

Key features of the system include adding new books, updating and deleting book records, issuing and returning books, managing member details, and generating reports for administrative use. The login system ensures secure access to administrative functions. The application supports searching for books or users using filters, making data retrieval fast and efficient.

One of the core strengths of this project is its use of object-oriented programming principles such as classes, objects, encapsulation, and inheritance. The project also emphasizes the importance of error handling, modular code design, and clean user interface development.

Overall, the Library Management System is a practical demonstration of how Java and MySQL can be used to develop database-driven applications. It provides a strong foundation for learners to explore more advanced concepts such as network programming, file handling, or web-based development in the future.
